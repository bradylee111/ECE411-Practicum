Lee's ideas:  Control light intensity through two polarizers: Inputs are Light sensors, and a knob for selecting desired light level
                                                              Output/actuator would be a motor turning one polarizer
                                                              Embedded systen would decide how much to turn the motor with feedback from
                                                                the sensor
              Ultrasonic/laser distance measuring device:     Input would be a button to take measurement and some reciever
                                                              Output would display a distance 
                                                              Embedded system would turn on the transmitter/speaker and reciever/microphone
                                                                and display data
              Convert Light colors to different sounds:       Use RGB color filters to make harmonus sounds, maybe connect to a telescope
                                                              
              
              I'll add more ideas as I think of them
              
             
Top idea: Spinning music box

            Inputs, speed knob (BPM???), and color wheel for song
            Output: speaker playing songs, Log speed measurements 
            
            Embedded system: convert series of flashing colors into series of frequencies to play at some inout speed
            
             Required hardware: Base, Variable speed dc, Color filters.
