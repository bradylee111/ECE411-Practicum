Watched videos about the brush motors and decided that we can control speed with either a variable resistor or 
using PWM from the microcontroller. Also discussed the possiblity of powering the motor with a battery to have 
less cables cluttering things during rotation. Motor would have to be placed parallel with power supply and resistor
for current controlled speed OR placed parallel with a diode and the combo in series with a transitor 
to ground for a PWM setup.
